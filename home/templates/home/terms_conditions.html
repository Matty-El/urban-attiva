                    <p>We use trusted third party logistics providers to deliver our goods.</p>
                    <p>Dispatch times may vary according to availability and any guarantees or representations made as
                        to delivery times are subject to any delays resulting from postal delays or other occurrences
                        beyond our control for which we will not be responsible.</p>
                    <p>If there is a delay in delivering the goods we will inform you of this via email and the goods
                        will be despatched as soon as available.</p>
                    <p>You have the right to request a cancellation if your order is delayed, just contact us with your
                        order number and we will do our best to assist.</p>
                    <p>Occasionally we find ourselves having to withdraw an item because it has become obsolete or has
                        been discontinued. If you have placed an order for an item that has been made obsolete we will
                        inform you as soon as possible and offer you an alternative if one is available.</p>
                    <p>Delivery of the goods will occur when we deliver them to the address you provide us with when you
                        make your order. You are responsible for the goods when delivery has taken place.</p>
                    <p>We may need to deliver your goods in separate instalments. If that is the case we will let you
                        know in advance.</p>
                    <p>If your delivery address is in the Scottish Highlands and Islands, Isle of Man and Northern
                        Ireland, delivery times may be extended depending on the exact location.</p>
                    <p>Deliveries cannot be made to PO Box addresses. We strongly advise against deliveries to be made
                        to hotels or third party couriers.& Any orders made, to be sent to a hotel or a third party
                        courier, are entirely at your own risk once delivery has been made by our logistics provider.

                    <p>You also have rights under The Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional
                        Charges) Regulations 2013 which state that up to 14 days after receiving your goods, in most
                        cases, you can change your mind and get a full refund. You have the right to cancel this
                        contract within 14 days from delivery without giving any reason. This right does not apply to
                        any customised or personalised goods bought through our website. To exercise this right please
                        Contact Us prior to the expiry of the cancellation rights period.</p>
                    <p>If you cancel this contract, we will reimburse to you all payments received from you, including
                        the costs of delivery (except for the supplementary costs arising if you chose a type of
                        delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by us).</p>
                    <p>We may make a deduction from the reimbursement for loss in value of any goods supplied, if the
                        loss is the result of unnecessary handling by you.</p>
                    <p>We will make the reimbursement without undue delay, and not later than:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>14 days after the day we received back from you any goods supplied; or</li>
                        <li>(if earlier) 14 days after the day you provide evidence that you have returned the goods; or
                        </li>
                        <li>if there were no goods supplied, 14 days after the day on which we are informed about your
                            decision to cancel this contract.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We will make the reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial
                        transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any
                        fees as a result of the reimbursement.</p>
                    <p>The Consumer Rights Act 2015 says goods must be as described, fit for purpose and of satisfactory
                        quality. During the expected lifespan of your product you're entitled to the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>up to 30 days: if your goods are faulty, then you can get a refund;</li>
                        <li>up to six months: if they can't be repaired or replaced, then you're entitled to a full
                            refund, in most cases;</li>
                        <li>up to six years: if the goods do not last a reasonable length of time, you may be entitled
                            to some money back.</li>
                    </ul>
